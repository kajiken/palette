    "      - Fake It: Returns hardcoded value first",
    "      - Triangulation: Adds second test to force generalization",
    "      - Obvious: Implements directly if confident",
    "  3e. GREEN: Writes MINIMAL code to pass the test",
    "  3f. GREEN: Runs test and observes PASS",
    "  3g. REFACTOR: Applies Tidyings (Guard Clauses, Dead Code, Extract Helper, etc.)",
    "  3h. REFACTOR: Runs test after each small change",
    "  3i. REFACTOR: If test fails, undoes and takes smaller step",

  "success_criteria": [
    "Test List is created before any implementation begins",
    "No implementation code is written before a test exists for it",
    "Each test is written assert-first (end result, then setup)",
    "Each test is executed and shown to FAIL before implementation begins",
    "Failure message is read and understood before proceeding to GREEN",
    "Implementation strategy is chosen based on confidence level",
    "Fake It strategy uses hardcoded values initially",
    "Triangulation uses multiple tests to force generalization",
    "Implementation is minimal - only enough to pass the current test",
    "Each test is executed and shown to PASS after implementation",
    "Refactoring applies Tidyings from 'Tidy First?'",
    "Tests are re-run after every small refactoring change",
    "If refactoring breaks tests, changes are undone immediately",
    "Step size adjusts to confidence (smaller when uncertain)",
    "RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle is strictly followed without shortcuts",
    "No test is written that passes immediately without implementation",
    "Tests are never removed (safety net principle)",
    "All requirements from Issue have corresponding tests in Test List",
